Hi, I’m Sumit.

I’m a swe based in Japan with a passion for AI. I love coffee, machine learning, and [geoguessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/).

This is my graph of thoughts, notes, and ideas.

I ramble about things on my [blog](./blog); you can check it out :)

I also document my learnings through learning reflections every week. You can [take a look at those here](./learning).

**As a brief overview:**

- [blog](./blog)
- [references](./references)
- [learning documentation](./learning)
- [books](./books)
- [papers](./papers)
