## Whats my Story?

Born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria. I moved alone to the US in 2015 for highschool. While I had visited the US a few times, this move scared me. It was a massive change of scenery but a managable adjustment in pace ( moved to a small city in Virginia ). While the pace was not too bad, I could not shake the anxiety in leaving a place I was so familiar with to head to the West for the sake of education. It all seemed a bit too permanent and solidified the fact that I would have to make peace with uncharted territory and plot my way even at my young age.

After I graduated high school I moved down to Atlanta, GA. A primed utopia ()

I graduated at Georgia State University with a Degree in Advanced Analytics and a minor in finance.
